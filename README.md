# Tableau Public Visualizations

## Background

In this section we go over some of the visualizations I've created by participating in **Workout Wednesday**. These
are both weekly challenges where participants construct compelling stories of data utilizing technologies such as Tableau, Power BI, etc...
I participated in these challenges to better understand how to communicate data to others

### [Workout Wednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/)

> **Workout Wednesday** is a weekly challenge to re-create a data-driven visualization. The challenges are designed to grow participants knowledge of Tableau and help kick-start personal development. Each Wednesday a challenge is release and participants are asked to replicate the challenge that is posed as closely as possible.
